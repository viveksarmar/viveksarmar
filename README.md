## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vivek Sarma Ravuri, FRM

Iâ€™m a Quantitative Researcher and Fixed Income Analyst with over 10 years of experience spanning Portfolio Management, Risk Analytics, and Data Science.

ðŸ’¼ At Franklin Templeton Investments, I partnered with Portfolio Managers and Traders to manage $15B+ AUM in Agency MBS portfolios, developing quantitative trading and risk models that optimized duration, convexity, and prepayment risks. Iâ€™ve built scalable research systems in Python and PHP, reducing trade workflow time from hours to minutes and enabling real-time performance attribution and backtesting.

ðŸŽ¯ My expertise bridges Quant Finance, Machine Learning, and Portfolio Optimization â€” combining financial intuition with data-driven modeling.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring systematic strategy design and multi-asset portfolio research within the Quant and Asset Management space.

ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on Quant Research, Trading Systems, or Data Science projects.

ðŸ’¬ Reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss US Fixed Income, Indian Mutual Funds, or Quantitative Investing.
